Introduction
This project aims to help you build a dynamic portfolio website using the popular JavaScript frameworks, Node.js for backend and React for frontend. With a dynamic portfolio, you can easily showcase your projects and skills in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AniketKumar06/Portfoilo.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd portfolio-website
Install the required dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

bash
Copy code
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
Project Structure
The project structure is organized into two main parts:

Backend (Node.js): This is where you'll handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
Frontend (React): This is where you'll build the user interface, components, and handle client-side interactions.
Here's a simplified overview of the project structure:

php
Copy code
portfolio-website/
├── backend/
│   ├── routes/         # API route definitions
│   ├── controllers/    # Request handlers
│   ├── models/         # Data models and schemas
│   └── server.js       # Express server setup
│
└── frontend/
    ├── public/         # Static assets
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/ # Reusable React components
    │   ├── pages/      # Individual pages of the portfolio
    │   ├── App.js      # Main React application component
    │   └── index.js    # Entry point for React app
    │
    └── package.json    # Frontend package configuration
Configuration
Before running the application, you might need to configure environment variables, database connections, and other settings. Check the respective README files in the backend and frontend directories for configuration details.

Development
To start the development environment:

Run the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
In a separate terminal window, run the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:3001, and the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
Once you're satisfied with your portfolio website, you can deploy it to a hosting provider of your choice. Popular options include Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, and AWS.

Remember to configure deployment settings, environment variables, and database connections based on your deployment platform.
